# processManager
Simple to use memory manipulation tool/library intended for game hacking written in C++. It is designed to work on both internal hacks (which have direct access to process memory) and external hacks which uses Windows API functions such as **WriteProcessMemory()** and **ReadProcessMemory()** for memory manipulation.

A very basic external name changer for the game Call of Duty: Mondern Warfare 3 can be seen bellow.
